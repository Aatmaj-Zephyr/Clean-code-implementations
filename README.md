Lets practise cleaning code.

Paste links of Pull requests or commits which highlight the change before and after code is cleaned.

Example-
1) [Renaming of variables](https://github.com/Aatmaj-Zephyr/Travelling-salesman/commit/ef7a197b472288bd6746d72627017a4074f6a919)
2) [Implementation of a design pattern](https://github.com/Aatmaj-Zephyr/Neural-networks-in-Java/pull/23)



How to contribute?

1) Clean up code from any repository following clean code principles- https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29
2) Create a pull request
3) Paste the link of the pull request in the readme of the repo which highlights the changes made in the code
4) LEarners can cpmpare the code before cleaning and after cleaning and learn from it..
